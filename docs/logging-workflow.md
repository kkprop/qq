# Timeline Logging Workflow

*How to continuously maintain the development timeline for clear architecture and implementation tracking.*

## When to Log Timeline Entries

### **Always Log These Events**
- **Architecture Decisions** - New components, design patterns, system structure changes
- **Major Implementations** - New features, core functionality additions
- **Design Changes** - Modifications to existing designs, requirement changes
- **Bug Fixes** - Significant fixes that affect system behavior
- **Refactoring** - Code reorganization that impacts architecture

### **Consider Logging These Events**
- **Configuration Changes** - Build system, dependency updates
- **Documentation Updates** - Major doc restructuring (like we just did)
- **Testing Milestones** - MVP validation, integration testing results
- **Performance Improvements** - Optimizations that change system behavior

## Timeline Entry Template

Copy this template for new entries:

```markdown
### YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM - [TYPE] Brief Description
**Context**: Why this change was needed
**Decision**: What was decided/implemented  
**Impact**: How this affects the system
**Commit**: `hash` - commit message
**Files**: List of key files changed
```

## Entry Types

| Type | When to Use | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `ARCH` | System architecture changes | Adding new component, changing data flow |
| `IMPL` | Feature implementation | New CLI command, storage system |
| `DESIGN` | Design decisions | API design, user experience choices |
| `FIX` | Bug fixes | Compilation errors, runtime issues |
| `REFACTOR` | Code reorganization | Moving functions, improving structure |
| `CONFIG` | Build/config changes | Dependencies, build system updates |
| `DOC` | Documentation updates | Major doc restructuring |
| `TEST` | Testing milestones | MVP validation, integration tests |

## Logging Process

### **Before Making Changes**
1. **Identify the change type** - Is this ARCH, IMPL, DESIGN, etc.?
2. **Note the context** - Why is this change needed?
3. **Plan the decision** - What will be implemented/changed?

### **During Implementation**
1. **Track key files** - Note which files are being modified
2. **Document decisions** - If design changes during implementation, note why

### **After Implementation**
1. **Add timeline entry** - Use the template above
2. **Include commit hash** - Reference the commit that implements the change
3. **Describe impact** - How does this change affect the overall system?

### **Before Committing**
1. **Update timeline.md** - Add the new entry
2. **Update development-log.md** - Update status if needed
3. **Commit both** - Include timeline update in the same commit or immediately after

## Timeline Maintenance

### **Daily Practice**
- **End of session**: Review what was accomplished, add timeline entries
- **Before major changes**: Check timeline to understand recent context
- **During design discussions**: Reference timeline for decision history

### **Weekly Review**
- **Scan recent entries** - Ensure nothing major was missed
- **Update current status** - Reflect recent progress in timeline
- **Plan next milestones** - Update upcoming milestones section

### **Monthly Cleanup**
- **Review entry quality** - Ensure entries are clear and useful
- **Archive old sections** - Move very old entries to separate archive file
- **Update documentation links** - Ensure timeline references are current

## Integration with Development Workflow

### **With Git Commits**
```bash
# 1. Make changes
# 2. Update timeline.md with entry
# 3. Commit both together
git add src/qq/core.clj docs/timeline.md
git commit -m "Implement default session logic

- Add auto-create default session on first ask
- Update timeline with implementation details"
```

### **With Design Documents**
- **Before writing design docs** - Check timeline for context
- **After design decisions** - Add DESIGN entry to timeline
- **When implementing designs** - Reference design doc in IMPL entry

### **With Issue Tracking**
- **Timeline entries can reference issues** - "Fixes issue #123"
- **Issues can reference timeline** - "See timeline entry 2025-07-27 10:00"
- **Milestones align with timeline** - Use timeline to plan releases

## Timeline Quality Guidelines

### **Good Timeline Entries**
- **Clear context** - Reader understands why change was needed
- **Specific decisions** - What exactly was implemented/decided
- **Measurable impact** - How system behavior changed
- **Traceable** - Commit hash and files for reference

### **Example Good Entry**
```markdown
### 2025-07-27 10:15 - [IMPL] Intelligent Naming Service
**Context**: Need descriptive session names without user burden
**Decision**: Dedicated Q window (qq-naming-service) generates terse names
**Impact**: Auto-generated meaningful names, leverages Q's intelligence
**Commit**: `0ed30da` - Initial MVP implementation
**Files**: 
- src/qq/naming.clj - Naming service implementation
- Creates dedicated tmux session for name generation
```

### **Avoid These Patterns**
- **Vague context** - "Needed to fix things"
- **Unclear decisions** - "Made some changes"
- **Missing impact** - No explanation of system effects
- **No traceability** - Missing commit hash or file references

## Tools and Automation

### **Timeline Entry Helper Script** (Future)
```bash
# Could create a script to help with timeline entries
./scripts/log-timeline.sh IMPL "Default session logic" \
  --context "Users need immediate Q access" \
  --files "src/qq/core.clj,src/qq/session.clj"
```

### **Timeline Validation** (Future)
- **Check for missing entries** - Compare commits to timeline entries
- **Validate entry format** - Ensure all required fields present
- **Link validation** - Ensure commit hashes exist

## Benefits of Consistent Timeline Logging

### **For Current Development**
- **Clear context** - Understand why decisions were made
- **Avoid repetition** - See what approaches were already tried
- **Track progress** - Visible momentum and accomplishments

### **For Future Development**
- **Onboarding** - New contributors understand evolution
- **Debugging** - Trace when behaviors were introduced
- **Architecture reviews** - See how system evolved over time

### **For Project Management**
- **Progress tracking** - Clear milestones and achievements
- **Decision documentation** - Rationale for architectural choices
- **Risk assessment** - Identify patterns in problems and solutions

*This workflow ensures our timeline remains a valuable resource for understanding QQ's development journey and architectural evolution.*
