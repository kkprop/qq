  "🎯 Shell Functionality Test - Full Shell Experience
  
  This test verifies all the enhanced shell features:
  - Backspace and Delete keys
  - Arrow key navigation (cursor movement and history)
  - Ctrl shortcuts (A, B, E, F, K, U, W, L)
  - Home/End keys
  - Command history
  
  Provides the full shell experience users expect!"
