  "🚀 THE Definitive WebSocket Server - Complete End-to-End Q&A Flow + Streaming
  
  This is THE ONLY WebSocket server implementation we need.
  Features:
  - Working WebSocket handshake
  - Complete WebSocket frame processing  
  - Proper Q&A boundaries (uses qq.tmux/send-and-wait-improved)
  - 🌊 TMUX STREAMING: Real-time character streaming from tmux sessions
  - Clean architecture (no nested try-catch hell)
  
  No more confusion about which server to use!"
