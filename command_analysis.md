# Amazon Q Command Wrapping Analysis

## High Value Commands (Definitely Worth Wrapping)

### 🎯 **Context Management** ✅ Already Done
- `/context` - File context management
- **Value**: Session tracking, monitoring, file path validation
- **Status**: ✅ Implemented with transparent forwarding

### 💾 **Session Persistence**
- `/save` - Save conversations
- `/load` - Load conversations  
- **Value**: Integration with QQ session management, backup tracking
- **Benefit**: Could integrate with QQ's session metadata system

### 🛠️ **Tools & Permissions**
- `/tools` - Tool management
- **Value**: Security monitoring, tool usage tracking
- **Benefit**: Monitor which tools Q is using across sessions

## Medium Value Commands (Good Candidates)

### ✏️ **Content Management**
- `/editor` - External editor integration
- `/compact` - Conversation summarization
- **Value**: Better editor integration, summarization tracking
- **Benefit**: Could integrate with preferred editors, track compaction

### 📊 **System Information**
- `/usage` - Context window usage
- `/model` - Model selection
- **Value**: Resource monitoring, model usage tracking
- **Benefit**: Integrate with QQ's monitoring system

### 🔧 **Configuration**
- `/profile` - Profile management
- `/hooks` - Context hooks
- **Value**: Profile switching integration, hook monitoring
- **Benefit**: Could sync with QQ session profiles

## Lower Value Commands (Maybe Not Worth It)

### 🚪 **Basic Operations**
- `/quit` - Application exit
- `/clear` - Clear history
- `/help` - Show help
- **Value**: Limited - these are simple operations
- **Benefit**: Minimal, might add unnecessary complexity

### 🎫 **External Services**
- `/subscribe` - Subscription management
- `/issue` - GitHub issue creation
- `/mcp` - MCP server info
- **Value**: These are external integrations
- **Benefit**: Limited, mostly informational

## Recommended Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: High-Impact Commands ⭐⭐⭐
```bash
bb save [name]           # Save conversation with QQ integration
bb load [name]           # Load conversation with session management
bb tools                 # Monitor tool usage across sessions
```

### Phase 2: Monitoring Integration ⭐⭐
```bash
bb usage                 # Context usage with QQ monitoring
bb model [model-name]    # Model selection with tracking
bb compact               # Conversation compaction with logging
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Integration ⭐
```bash
bb editor                # Enhanced editor integration
bb profile [name]        # Profile management with QQ sync
bb hooks                 # Context hooks with monitoring
```

## Implementation Complexity Assessment

### Easy (Similar to /context) 🟢
- `/save`, `/load`, `/usage`, `/model`, `/tools`
- Simple command forwarding with response capture

### Medium (Requires Integration) 🟡  
- `/editor` - Need to handle external editor workflow
- `/compact` - Should integrate with QQ's summarization
- `/profile` - Should sync with QQ session profiles

### Complex (Significant Integration) 🔴
- `/hooks` - Complex context hook management
- Advanced `/save`/`/load` with QQ session metadata

## Recommendation: **Not Too Bold!** 

**Start with Phase 1 (High-Impact Commands)**
- These provide clear value and are straightforward to implement
- `/save` and `/load` would integrate beautifully with QQ's session system
- `/tools` monitoring would provide valuable security insights

**The transparent wrapper pattern we built is perfect for this expansion!**
